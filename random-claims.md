# Random Claims

These claims have not been verified. Neither has the rest of this website :)

Loras trained on Wan2.1-VACE-14B-diffusers work though not perfectly with WanAnimate.

Negative prompt is ignored with CFG=1 in wrapper samplers but can be re-enabled by using `WanVideoNAG` node.

Not bad for realism: 250928 from [LoRAs/Wan22-Lightning](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Wan2.2-Lightning/tree/main) 0.7 strength, 1.4 CFG, 3 steps on WAN 2.2 low noise.
