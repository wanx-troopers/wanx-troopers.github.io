# Image Upscalers and Detailers

This page is a work in progress

## Simplest: Upscale Image By

Use stock ComfyUI node `Upscale Image By` with `upscale_method`=`lanczoc`

## Detailer (SEGS)

There are two Github repositories to get nodes from

- [GH:ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) the orginal main repository
- [GH:drozbay/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/drozbay/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) a copy by [Drozbay](hidden-knowledge.md#drozbay)
  which is also used in his created by not very widely known
  SEGS/VACE video [detailer](upscalers-detailers-video.md#drozbays-impact-pack-segs-detailer-for-wan-video-and-vace)
