# Lynx

Lynx is a new facility to introduce character likeness from a single reference image
into Wan 2.1 (and to extent low noise 2.2) family of models for AI video generation.

Lynx appears inferior to Phantom/Stand-in.
However Kijai has provided an implementation to experiment with.
The implementation is shaped as two LoRA-s and new nodes.

Kijai:
> lite ip adapter + full ref actually works and seemingly better  
> it's not 2.2 model  
> it works somewhat on the A14B low noise  
> the ID is okayish but can't really get any motion, though probably spoiled by 2.2 by now in that regard :)

Other opinion:
> Bah the more testing I’ve done it seems lynx has no effect with wananimate.
> Running with different people for each and its just the wananimate embeds taking over even with ip str at 2.

[Example workflow](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/blob/main/example_workflows/wanvideo_T2V_14B_lynx_example_01.json)

Lynx has been tested with T2V WAN models. Kijai:
> got it to run with I2V, but dunno if it's doing anything  
> high enough ref strength and it does inject the ref into the gen... one way or the other  
> 1.5

Faster motion with Lynx? Close to 24fps.

There is an unconfirmed report of Lynx working with [Wan Animate](wan-animate.md).
