[Aquif Image 14B](https://huggingface.co/aquif-ai/aquif-Image-14B) derived from Wan 2.2 has been released

> It's much better for image gen than base model that's for sure.

> I call that distill look; but I agree zit looks less AI than other models

A surprising match was found between `.safetensors` shared as Aquif and `Magic-Wan-Image-V1`.
