# Other Image Models

A number of image generation models are being released.
This website doesn't go deep into details but aims to at least list them.

## Magic Wan

> And it has the natural look which I personally prefer than the over "RLd" [extremely artificial] look that Z-Image has.

> Haven't noticed that, z-image looks very realistic to me

> I call that distill look; but I agree zit looks less AI than other models

## LongCat

While previously LongCat referred only to a video generation model now we also have image generation and editing models under the same name
