# Segmentation

## Sam3

Community is experimenting with SAM3 model from Facebook. The model provides several capabilities

- segmentation
- depth maps

Sam3D praised as new in segmentation models.

Several ComfyUI implementations:

- [GH:Ltamann/ComfyUI-TBG-SAM3](https://github.com/Ltamann/ComfyUI-TBG-SAM3)
- [GH:PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3)
- [GH:PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3DBody](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3DBody) "They don't release VRAM quite as well as you'd expect. They work, but lack optimization"

Sentiment: "crazy", "Sec4B still doing better"
