# Kandinsky-5

Experiments with running the model in ComfyUI on consumer hardware are in their initial stages.
Here is one work-in-progress implementation: [HF:Ada123-a/ComfyUI-Kandinsky](https://github.com/Ada123-a/ComfyUI-Kandinsky)

Experiments suggest it is possible to generate longer than 10 sec clips, say 15 sec without looping or obvious quality problems.
