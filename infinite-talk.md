# Infinite Talk

This section is incomplete.

## Models

Infinite Talk workflows utilize regular Wan I2V safetensors file with regular speed lora of your choice.

They additionally use a "InfiniteTalk Model" such as `Wan_2_1-InfiniteTalk-Multi_fp16.safetensors`. It is loaded by `WanVideo Long I2V Multi/InfiniteTalk` which similar to VACE plugs into `VanVideo Model Loader`.

`clip_vision_h` and `wav2vec` .safetensors files are loaded as well.

Can do start image + audio to video as well as start video + audio to video. Can use up to 4 audio tracks and masks to show which character is associated with which file.
