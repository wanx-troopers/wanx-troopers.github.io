# Extra Tools

Image tools useful alongside video AI.
Sometimes autogenerated sound can be of use too.

## Video Blending From Fragments

[kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) contains `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`
which can be used to merge together original video with its extension done using I2V or VACE mask extension techniques.
Example of it being used in a LongCat wf: [extend-with-overlap](screenshots/extend-with-overlap.png).

`WanVideoBlender` from [GH:banodoco/steerable-motion](https://github.com/banodoco/steerable-motion) is an alternative.

## Trent Nodes

[TrentHunter82/TrentNodes](https://github.com/TrentHunter82/TrentNodes/tree/main) contains `Cross Dissolve with Overlap` node
as well as other nodes for examining videos, taking last N frames, creating latent masks and VACE keyframing.

> Inside of Comfy you could Use Stable Audio or ACE... but tbh both are not that good

## Hiding In Plain Sight

- `Resize Image v2` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) new mode is `total_pixels` copies what `WanVideo Image Resize To Closest` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) does which is original Wan logic
- `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) to compose extensions created with VACE extend techniques
- `Video Info` from [Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) + `Preview Any` to debug dimension errors in ComfyUI etc
