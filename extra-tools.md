# Extra Tools

Image tools useful alongside video AI.
Sometimes autogenerated sound can be of use too.

## Video Blending From Fragments

[kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) contains `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`
which can be used to merge together original video with its extension done using I2V or VACE mask extension techniques.
Example of it being used in a LongCat wf: [extend-with-overlap](screenshots/extend-with-overlap.png).

See also the next section on `Trent Nodes`

## Trent Nodes

[TrentHunter82/TrentNodes](https://github.com/TrentHunter82/TrentNodes/tree/main) contains `Cross Dissolve with Overlap` node
as well as other nodes for examining videos, taking last N frames, creating latent masks and VACE keyframing.

## Frame Interpolation

To increase FPS: RIFE VFI still good to double frame rate with rife49.pth, can plug after stock `Upscale Image By` with `upscale_method`=`lanczoc`.
Faster alternative suggested online: `FL RIFE Frame Interpolation` from [GH:filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes](https://github.com/filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes) again with rife49.

> Film - it's an alternative to RIFE?

`WanVideoBlender` from [GH:banodoco/steerable-motion](https://github.com/banodoco/steerable-motion) is an alternative.

## More Foley-s

- ACE Foley Generator

> Inside of Comfy you could Use Stable Audio or ACE... but tbh both are not that good

## Hiding In Plain Sight

- `Resize Image v2` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) new mode is `total_pixels` copies what `WanVideo Image Resize To Closest` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) does which is original Wan logic
- `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) to compose extensions created with VACE extend techniques
- `Video Info` from [Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) + `Preview Any` to debug dimension errors in ComfyUI etc

## Misc

- IndexTTS2: "I had Chatterbox, IndexTTS, another IndexTTS node, Chatterboxt5, VibeVoice ... IndexTTS seems a lot better"
