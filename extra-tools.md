## Honourable Mention

VibeVoice TTS

`SuperPrompt` node from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes).

`Merge Images` node from VideoHelperSuite (so called VHS)

[Urabewe/OllamaVision](https://github.com/Urabewe/OllamaVision) a SwarmUI extension to generate prompts.

[GH:chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle](https://github.com/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle) can add film grain to images.

## Useful Nodes

* `Resize Image v2` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) new mode is `total_pixels` copies what `WanVideo Image Resize To Closest` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) does which is original Wan logic
* `Video Info` from [Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) + `Preview Any` to debug dimension errors in ComfyUI etc
* `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) to compose extensions created with VACE extend techniques

## Frame Interpolation

To increase FPS: RIFE VFI still good to double frame rate with rife49.pth, can plug after stock `Upscale Image By` with `upscale_method`=`lanczoc`. Faster alternative suggested online: `FL RIFE Frame Interpolation` from [GH:filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes](https://github.com/filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes) again with rife49.
