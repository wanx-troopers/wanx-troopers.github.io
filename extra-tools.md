# Extra Tools

Image tools useful alongside video AI.
Sometimes autogenerated sound can be of use too.

## Video Blending From Fragments

[kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) contains `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`
which can be used to merge together original video with its extension done using I2V or VACE mask extension techniques.
Example of it being used in a LongCat wf: [extend-with-overlap](screenshots/extend-with-overlap.png).

`WanVideoBlender` from [GH:banodoco/steerable-motion](https://github.com/banodoco/steerable-motion) is an alternative.

## Z-Image-Turbo

6B `Z-Image-Turbo` introduced around 2025.11.26 is a distilled image generation model released under Apache license. Community is raving :) Model re-uses Flux VAE but appears not be based on Flux.
[Model page](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo) promises non-distilled and edit versions to be released. "beats flux 2 .. at a fraction of the size ... less plastic than qwen image".

LoRa-s creating is being tried, however just prompting alone goes a very long way.
Prompts are using an unusual encoder which composes a system - user dialogue at some point.
Apparently this is how the model has been trained. This leads to unusual tools like the one discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1parzxf) to be created.

## Qwen

### Qwen Image Edit

Supposedly has affinity to Wan models since both come from Alibaba.

### Notable Loras For Qwen Image Edit

Generates 1st frame for next scene in same location with same character.
Sample workflow on HF next to LoRA.

| HF Space | LoRA |

Text editing similar to Nano Banana (dataset [visualizer](https://snazzy-selkie-ebdccf.netlify.app/), [dataset](https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k))

### MMAudio

[kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio)

### ACE

### Other Ideas

> Inside of Comfy you could Use Stable Audio or ACE... but tbh both are not that good

## Honourable Mention

IndexTTS2: "I had Chatterbox, IndexTTS, another IndexTTS node, Chatterboxt5, VibeVoice ... IndexTTS seems a lot better"

VibeVoice TTS

`SuperPrompt` node from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes).

`Merge Images` node from VideoHelperSuite (so called VHS)

[Urabewe/OllamaVision](https://github.com/Urabewe/OllamaVision) a SwarmUI extension to generate prompts.

[GH:chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle](https://github.com/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle) can add film grain to images.

## Z-Image

`CRT-Nodes` added `LoRA Loader (Z-Image)(CRT)`. It can load `zit-ivy.safetensors`

## Useful Nodes

* `Resize Image v2` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) new mode is `total_pixels` copies what `WanVideo Image Resize To Closest` from [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) does which is original Wan logic
* `Video Info` from [Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) + `Preview Any` to debug dimension errors in ComfyUI etc
* `Image Batch Extend With Overlap`from [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) to compose extensions created with VACE extend techniques

## Frame Interpolation

To increase FPS: RIFE VFI still good to double frame rate with rife49.pth, can plug after stock `Upscale Image By` with `upscale_method`=`lanczoc`. Faster alternative suggested online: `FL RIFE Frame Interpolation` from [GH:filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes](https://github.com/filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-Nodes) again with rife49.
