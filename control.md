# Control Techniques

## I2V

### Unianimate

Kijai's adaptation of LoRa: [HF:Kijai/WanVideo_comfy:UniAnimate-Wan2.1-14B-Lora-12000-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/blob/main/UniAnimate-Wan2.1-14B-Lora-12000-fp16.safetensors).

Controls pose only

### FantasyPortrait

For face animation only

### MTV crafter

Very different from usual

## Uni3C

Camera control for Wan 2.1 (hmm which one?..)

## Q/A

> Q: Is there anything that does the same thing as Uni3C but for WAN 2.2?
> A: [TTM](wan-i2v-tricks.md#time-to-move) kinda, uni3C works at higher strength to some extent, combination of both could be interesting... also there's the Fun control camera which works good
