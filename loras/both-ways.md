A number of models exist both as models and as LoRA-s.

| Model | Notes | Preferences |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dyno | T2V Wan 2.2 High | Better as full-fat than as LoRa |
| Wan 2.2 I2V Moe Distill Lightx2v | I2V Wan 2.2 High only | As good as a LoRa? |
| CausVid | Wan 2.1, can be used as Wan 2.2 Low | Better as full-fat |
| Krea "Realtime" | Distill of Wan 2.1 14B T2V | Definitely better as full-fat |


## Krea Realtime

Doesn't work as a LoRa, somewhat works as a full-fat model. Difficult to use.
Produces naturally looking vidoes: soft colors, normal contrast.
Has been used instead of high-noise in Wan 2.2 workflow with rCM lora on high.

> Finally something that looks kind of realistic.. other 4 step models look so artificial  
> krea is causal like causvid
