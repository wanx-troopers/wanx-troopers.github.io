Trained from Wan 2.1 I2V 720p

Very strong character consistency

> such a hard model to use; 3 different image inputs and all should be handled differently

> clip vision is the 224x224, so you have to crop;
> QwenVL still unsure about... not 224, and not the full res either;
> their examples are mostly faces

> Q: How high is the res of the characters images u are using. Also, can u use a video as environemntal background? 
> A: 1280x720; it's reference images, can't use video
> Q: Can't use open pose video to drive animation or character movement either?
> A: maybe unianimate
