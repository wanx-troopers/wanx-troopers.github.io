# Wan I2V T2V / VACE Tricks

Note: [What Plugs Where](what-plugs-where/what-plugs-where.md) page contains some information on how native and wrapper workflows for VACE are constructed.
This page contains additional/advanced examples.

[drozbay](hidden-knowledge.md#drozbay) has shared the following advanced VACE workflows relying on his
[ComfyUI-WanVaceAdvanced](https://github.com/drozbay/ComfyUI-WanVaceAdvanced) node pack with ClownShark, Phantom and VACE:

- [Dancer](screenshots/drozbay_vacedancer_v1.png) - `DWPose Estimator` and `Depth Anything V2` as 2 separate VACE control videos
- [Falling Into The Water](workflows/droz_vace_reference_and_canny_v1.png) - `Canny Edge` limited by depth masking
