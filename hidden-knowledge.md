# Hidden Knowledge

By default `safetensors` files are loaded via `mmap`.

Kijai's nodes can convert between data types such as `bf16` at `safetensors` loading time.

`load_device` = `main_device` in `WanVideo Model Loader` means "keep model in VRAM".

| Kijai's Repo | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| [kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper)| Alternative to Native KSampler, "wrapper" nodes |
| [kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes)| Supplementary, can be used with Native KSampler |
| [kijai/ComfyUI-WanAnimatePreprocess](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanAnimatePreprocess) | Nodes for Kijai's WanAnimate workflow |
| [kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio) | Foley? |
| [kijai/ComfyUI-GIMM-VFI](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-GIMM-VFI) | frame interpolator |

Resolutions to try with WAN: 1536x864, 1280x768, 1/2 of that, 832x480, 1024x576.

Colored inputs on ComfyUI node designate non-optional inptus, rather than inputs that have something connected to them.

Too high CFG on low steps can cause "burns" and flashes.

`Resize Image v2` once reported that a 150 frame 480x832 video was taking slightly bellow 0.7Gb.

## RoPE

When using going beyond trained model resolution with a wrapper workflow can try using `WanVideo RoPE Function`.
Particularly with Cinescale LoRA can try setting this node to `comfy` and `f/h/w`=1/20/20 or 1/25/25; Kijai:

> I don't really remember the values but in the original they used something like [that](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AEyeline-Labs%2FCineScale%20ntk&type=code)  
> basically it's scaling the spatial rope in attempt to make larger resolutions work without the repeat effect  
> possibly the lora is trained with the scale of 20

Defaults are 1/1/1.
