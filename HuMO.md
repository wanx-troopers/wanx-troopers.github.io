# HuMO

It might be possible to replace i2v safetensors with HuMO ones in workflows using Kijai's `WanVideo Long I2V Multi/InfiniteTalk` and produce videos of considerable length using HuMO.
Audio embeds may be provided in InfiniteTalk manner, in HuMO manner or in both simultaneously using `WanVideo Combine Embeds` node.

HuMO might work with I2V workflows.

It is not possible to stop characters opening their mouth with HuMO (though you can try with silent audio).

Without InifiniteTalk HuMO is limited to less than 4 seconds of generation.
